I'm solving various programming problems, organizing them neatly into separate folders. Each problem has its own folder containing two files:

utils.py: This file holds reusable utility functions tailored to solve specific programming challenges. These functions are designed to be modular and maintainable, covering tasks such as sorting algorithms, string manipulation, and mathematical operations.

driver.py: This file serves as a demonstration of how the utility functions from utils.py are utilized. It includes sample inputs, function calls, and showcases the results. For example, if there's a function in utils.py for calculating factorials, driver.py would demonstrate how to call that function with different input values.

Additionally, there's a "test" folder housing files associated with each problem. These files contain test cases to verify the correctness of the utility functions, covering various scenarios, edge cases, and expected outcomes.

Here are some key highlights:

Calendar Module: For working with dates.
Floor, Ceiling, and Rounding: Utilizing floor_ceil_rint for rounding operations.
Iterators and Iterables: Helper functions in iterators_iterables for seamless interaction.
Linear Algebra Operations: The linear_algebra module.
Grade Calculation: Using marks_percentage for grade calculations.
Data Analysis: mean_var_std for mean, variance, and standard deviation calculations.
String Formatting: Convenient string formatting functions in string_format.
Text Alignment: text_alignment for text alignment tasks.
Time Operations: time_delta module for handling time differences.
Email Validation: Ensuring valid email addresses with validate_mail.
Furthermore, there are specific functions tailored for tasks such duplicate characters from substrings (merge_tool), finding min and max values (min_max), and modifying data structures on the fly (mutation). Additionally, there are functions for handling second-highest values (second_max) and working with named tuples (named_tuple). Finally, tasks like matching and unique value retrieval are addressed in the no_idea file, and data accumulation is handled efficiently with piling_up.
